An add-on to download an entire ebook Humble Bundle in a single click.

do).

2. click on `Load temporary add-on`;
3. load the `manifest.json` file.

I don't know but you can make a PR to tell me how to do it.

## Known bugs/peculiarities

Here's a list of known bugs I won't fix myself for now because I don't have
time for this:

Waiting for your PR :-)
